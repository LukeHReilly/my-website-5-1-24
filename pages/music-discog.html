            <h2>The Hybrid</h2>

            <p>Starting off, we have Danny Brown's first studio album, "The Hybrid", under the label Rappers I Know.
                Released on March 16, 2010, The Album featured a run of 16 songs, and a length of 46:38. This is one of
                Danny Browns most important albums, this is because its the first time he began to use his famous
                high-pitched voice. </p>
            <h2>XXX</h2>
            <p>In 2011, Danny Brown decided to sign to a different record label called Fool's Gold Records. Signing to
                Fool's Gold Records turned out to be one of Brown's best commercial moves that he made. The label would
                then help Danny Brown to release his second studio album on August 15, 2011 titled "XXX". The album had
                a run of 19 songs, and a length of 53:18. It happened to be named the best hip hop album of the year by
                Spin, and Pitchfork named the album to be the 19th best album of 2011.</p>
            <h2>Old</h2>
            <p>Old is the third studio album by Danny Brown, under Fool's Gold Records. Old was the first Danny Brown
                album to be sold officially. This album also had a run of 19 songs, with a length of 56:36. This was the
                first project from Brown that got a very widespread acclaim from music critics, it happened to sell
                15,000 copies in the first week of release, and also appeared number 18 on the US Billboard 200.</p>
            <h2>Atrocity Exhibition</h2>
            <p>Atrocity Exhibition is Danny Brown's most acclaimed, and best album to date. It was released under Fool's
                Gold Records on September 27, 2016, and had a run of 15 songs, and went on for 46:38.</p>
            <h2>U Know What I'm Sayin?</h2>
            <p>U know What I'm Sayin? was the first album from Danny Brown since XXX to be released under a new record
                label, Warp Records. It was released on October 4th, 2019, had a run of 11 songs and a length of 33:27.
                This was the first time that Danny Brown had worked with acclaimed rapper and producer JPEGMafia.</p>
            <h2>Quaranta</h2>
            <p>Quaranta is Danny Browns second album under Warp Records, and his sixth overall studio album. The record
                was released on November 17, 2023. It had a run of only 11 total songs, and a runtime of 34:23. Danny
                Brown named this album Quaranta, because it means 40 in Italian, which happened to be the age he was
                turning at the time. Quaranta featured more slow-paced methodical songs, that were much deeper than his
                other music. </p>
